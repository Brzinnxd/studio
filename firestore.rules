/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for customer-related data (customers and their orders),
 * allows public read access to product and trending flavor data,
 * and restricts write access to owner-only for customer and order data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /products/{productId}: Publicly readable product information.
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Customer profiles, where customerId must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId}: Orders associated with a customer, enforcing ownership via customerId.
 * - /trending_flavors/{trendingFlavorId}: Publicly readable trending flavor data.
 * - /business_transactions/{transactionId}: Business transactions, owner-only access.
 * - /personal_transactions/{transactionId}: Personal transactions, owner-only access.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Customers can only create, update, or delete their own profile.
 * - Customers can only create, update, or delete orders associated with their own profile.
 * - Products and trending flavors are publicly readable but writes are denied (implicit, assuming no write rules are added).
 * - Listing of customer profiles is denied.
 * - Business and personal transactions are only accessible to the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Customer and Order data are structured to ensure that access control can be performed via path-based ownership.
