/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for customer data and associated orders.
 *  It allows public read access to products and trending flavors, but restricts modifications to authenticated users.
 *  Financial transactions are segregated into business and personal contexts, with authenticated users only able to list business transactions and create, update, and delete personal transactions.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 *  - /products/{productId}: Publicly readable product catalog.
 *  - /customers/{customerId}: Customer profiles, where customerId matches the user's UID.
 *  - /customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId}: Orders associated with a specific customer.
 *  - /customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId}/order_items/{orderItemId}: Order items associated with a specific order.
 *  - /trending_flavors/{trendingFlavorId}: Publicly readable data about trending flavor combinations.
 *  - /business_transactions/{transactionId}: Business related transactions.
 *  - /personal_transactions/{transactionId}: Personal financial transactions for authenticated users.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *  - Customers can only access their own profile data and orders.
 *  - Products and trending flavors are publicly readable but not writable by clients.
 *  - Financial transactions are separated into business (publicly readable) and personal (user-modifiable).
 *  - Listing all customers or orders is disallowed to prevent data leakage.
 *  - Data validation is relaxed for rapid prototyping, focusing on authorization and relational integrity.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *  - Orders are stored as a subcollection of `/customers/{customerId}`, enabling direct security checks based on the customerId in the path without additional `get()` calls.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation
 *  - User-specific order data is stored under the `/customers/{customerId}` path, while public product and trending flavor data is stored in top-level collections.
