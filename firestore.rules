/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Angel's Sweets Emporium.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for customer-related data (profiles and orders)
 *                  and allows public read access to products and trending flavors.
 *                  Admin users (flagged in their user profile) have elevated privileges.
 * @data_structure The data is organized as follows:
 *                  - /users/{userId}: User profile data.
 *                  - /products/{productId}: Product information.
 *                  - /customers/{customerId}: Customer profile data.
 *                  - /customers/{customerId}/orders/{orderId}: Orders placed by a specific customer.
 *                  - /trending_flavors/{trendingFlavorId}: Trending flavor combinations.
 *                  - /business_transactions/{transactionId}: Business financial transactions
 *                  - /personal_transactions/{transactionId}: Personal financial transactions
 * @key_security_decisions
 *                  - User listing is disallowed.
 *                  - Public read access is granted to the products and trending_flavors collections.
 *                  - Strict ownership is enforced for user profiles and customer-related data.
 *                  - Business and personal transaction collections are publicly readable, but writes are forbidden in this prototype.
 * @denormalization_for_authorization N/A (Path-based ownership used for orders).
 * @structural_segregation User-specific data (orders) is stored in subcollections, while global data (products, trending flavors) is stored in top-level collections.
